# SYNOPSIS

    use Log::Dispatch;

    my $log = Log::Dispatch->new(
        'outputs' => [
            [
                'Screen::Gentoo',
                'min_level' => 'debug',
                'stderr'    => 1,

    $log->critical('No oh!');

# DESCRIPTION

This implements a colorful output that uses [Term::GentooFunctions](https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::GentooFunctions) to
print out the output.

It also works with indentation when using `eindent` and `eoutdent` from
[Term::GentooFunctions](https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::GentooFunctions).

One limitation this has is that there are only three colors, which means
that you cannot see a difference between levels `debug`, `notice`, and
`info` which all have a green color, or between `error`, `critical`,
`alert`, and `emergency` which all have a red color.

At least for now.

    Colors entire lines, not just the beginning. Try it out.
